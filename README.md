# landing-page

This project is going to show the foundational CSS and HTML abilities aquired by studying The Odin Project curriculum. Flexbox is the last studied topic and no JS has been added to the page as this is not part of the reviewed content so far.

I'm having problems with the alignment of the elements. I can see in the example that the "Header Logo" and "This website is awesome" texts are aligned, but I'm having difficulties accomplishing this with flexbox. I will try to do it by adding some padding and limiting the width of the section-1a element.

# landing-page

This project is going to show the foundational CSS and HTML abilities aquired by studying The Odin Project curriculum. Flexbox is the last studied topic and no JS has been added to the page as this is not part of the reviewed content so far.

The project has been finished. I was able to align all elements of the header using padding.
